            I'm G8MR, a teenage developer who likes cubing, maths (Yes, you read it right!) and is TOTALLY obsessed with Harry Potter (a bit obsessed with Star Wars as well, to be honest).
        </p><br><br>
        <p class = "para2">
            I work mainly on Python, but nevertheless I'm also working on web development - that is, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - as well as game development.
        </p><br><br>
        <p class = "para3">
            My hobbies are to write, read, cube, play around with Lego, listen to music, play chess, solve tough and mind-boggling riddles, as well as play the piano.
        </p><br><br>
        <p class = "para4">
            I'm currently working on CoreAI, a simple Python text-bot, as well as Patronium, my very own Python-based programming language.
